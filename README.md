# Forced-Van-der-Pol-Oscillator
Solving forced Van der Pol Differential equation using numerical methods in Python / MATLAB

This is used as the extra credit final project for MAE 82 "Mathematics of Engineering". The 
focus of this project is to create 1. a phase plot of a particular solution using constant 
parameters for epsilon, omega, and F and 2. Show the bifurcation diagram when F = 0.2239 and 
omega = 2*pi/10 with varying epsilon from 1 to 5 and 4.65 to 4.95.
